Isha Updates
============

An extension to keep track of updates on the Isha Blog (default page which can also be accessed by clicking on the Blog logo), Sadhguru's Youtube Channel (access it through the Youtube logo), his daily quotes (access it through Sadhguru's signature), and a Sounds of Isha music player (access it through the music icon).

You can also search an extensive online repository of Sadhguru's articles and books using the Wisdom Center search bar. A similar search function is present for Sadhguruâ€™s Youtube Channel.

The extension can also be configured to give you desktop popup reminders for your Isha Kriya sadhana. The popups can be turned on/off and the reminder duration is configurable in the extensions options page. By default these reminders are off. Right-click on the Isha icon next to the url bar and choose options to get the options page. The extension also notifies you when there are new posts on the Isha Blog.
